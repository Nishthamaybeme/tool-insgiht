            <h2>Tool Evolution</h2>
            <p>Before the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, goods such as cooking utensils, wagons, ships, and furniture were produced using hand tools to cut and shape materials. However, with the invention of the steam engine, power-driven machines took over production, requiring machine tools to create precise and consistent parts in large quantities. The development of machine tools, along with jigs and fixtures for securing the workpiece and guiding the tool, played a pivotal role in the emergence of mass production and interchangeable parts in the 19th century.</p>
                <p>The initial steam engines suffered from the lack of precision in early machine tools, which caused inaccuracies in the boring of engine cylinders. Within 50 years, key machine tools were developed to handle the machining of heavy metal parts with the necessary accuracy. Some of these tools were based on earlier woodworking machines, such as the metal lathe, which evolved from woodcutting lathes used in France as far back as the 16th century. In 1775, John Wilkinson in England designed a precision machine for boring engine cylinders, and in 1797, Henry Maudslay, also from England, invented a screw-cutting engine lathe, featuring a lead screw to drive the carriage at a constant speed, ensuring accurate threading. By 1800, Maudslay’s lathe was enhanced with 28 change gears, allowing it to cut threads of various pitches.</p>
                <p>The shaper, invented by James Nasmyth, was another key development in machining technology. It used a reciprocating motion to plane small surfaces and cut keyways. Nasmyth also invented the steam hammer in 1839 for forging heavy pieces. Joseph Whitworth, another of Maudslay’s students, made significant contributions to machine tools, and his company dominated the field by the mid-19th century. At the 1862 International Exhibition, Whitworth’s firm showcased its machine tools across a quarter of the exhibition space.</p>
                <p>While Britain tried to maintain its lead in machine-tool development by restricting exports, the industrial advancements in other countries, particularly in continental Europe and the United States, led to widespread adoption of British-made tools. Notable advancements outside Britain included Eli Whitney’s milling machine, which he produced in 1818 for firearm manufacturing, and J.R. Brown’s universal milling machine in 1862. The turret lathe, developed in the U.S. in the 19th century, introduced automated processes, particularly for screw-making, anticipating the major technological changes of the 20th century. By 1896, American engineer F.W. Fellows perfected the gear-shaping machine, capable of producing gears quickly and efficiently.</p>
                <p>The late 19th century also saw the emergence of grinding machines, fueled by the production of artificial abrasives. C.H. Norton’s grinding machine, capable of grinding an automobile crankshaft in just 15 minutes—compared to the previous five-hour process—illustrated the potential of this new technology.</p>
                <p>By the end of the 19th century, there had been a revolution in the way metals were shaped and processed, laying the foundation for mass production and an industrialized society. The 20th century saw further improvements, including the use of multiple-point cutters for milling machines, the introduction of automated systems controlled by electronics and hydraulics, and nontraditional methods like electrochemical and ultrasonic machining. Despite these advancements, the core machine tools developed in the 19th century still remain the foundation for modern manufacturing.</p>
